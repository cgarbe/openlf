example_python_extension
=========================

ONLY TESTED FOR A UBUNTU SYSTEM!
WINDOWS AND MAC COULD NOT WORK OUT OF THE BOX!

The folder exampe_python_extension contains a c++ python extension which 
uses boost::python and vigra.

The module should be build in source ( source and build folder should be the same)
A module "my_module" will be build.

Copy the complete my_module folder and rename my_module (and _my_module) in all files
to the name of your python extension ( for exampe region_graph or feature_extractor)
